The Odin Project: Calculator

# Description

This project reflects the culmination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript fundamentals obtained via the foundations module of The Odin Project (TOP). This webpage is a virtual copy of a basic handheld calculator complete with the 4 standard functions, a delete/backspace button, and 0-9 numeric input buttons. To accomplish this I relied heavily on functional programming and near-constant DOM manipulation. My biggest assest during this challenge was employing counter variables that help track which step the user is on in regards to the computation process. Using these variables I could make sure the appropriate DOM elements were being updated while avoiding issues with the function that handles the computation. Overall this project was a bit challenging to keep DRY, however I feel that the core functionality is sound and the naming conventions are mostly self-descriptive. Thank you for taking a look at this project!
